  - GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE! Did you get enough beauty rest?
  - While you were napping, all the other recruits have already finished their training
    and gone home!
  - Because of you, I was forced to wait around here. And now I'm LOCKED out of the
    courtyard!
  - We need to open the gate but the LEVER is blocked by those CRATES.
  - To PUSH OBJECTS, move towards them. You can INTERACT with LEVERS and other objects
    the same way.
  - And if you MAKE A MISTAKE, you can UNDO your moves by pressing "Z"
  - ...
  - Well, what're you waiting for? Get to work!
