  - And under NO circustances are you to let this prisoner escape. Understand?
  - Good. Complete this task and you will have proven your loyalty to the Kingdom
    of Dawghaus.
  - Now, if you will excuse me, I have urgent business elsewhere. I've wasted enough
    of my precious time here.
  - ' I leave the prisoner in your hands. Farewell.'
